        <p><b>
            The following describes the terms applicable to the use of the triiii.com website (the “Site”). Your use of the Site forms a legally binding contract with triiii, org. (“TRIIII” or “us”) based on these Terms of Use. If you have registered as a Solver, you will be bound to these Terms of Use as well as additional terms in any applicable Challenge-Specific Agreement. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY. If you do not accept the Terms of Use as stated here, do not use the Site. TRIIII may revise these Terms of Use at any time by posting an updated version to this Web page.
        </b></p>

        <p>
            <b>1. The Site.</b> This Site provides a service ("Service(s)") whereby entities with business, technical, engineering, scientific, logistical, manufacturing, or mathematical problems ("Seekers") may post such problems ("TRIIII Challenges®" also referred to as TRIIII Challenge Statements) and may offer a payment amount (each, an "Award") for solutions submitted by Solvers for a specific TRIIII Challenge via the website (“Proposed Solutions”), which the Seeker deems acceptable ("Accepted Solutions") based upon the structure of the challenge. Seekers may be commercial enterprises, not-for-profit organizations, local, state, or federal governments (including agencies of the Government), or other entities. Each challenge type has differing levels of difficulty, and information required from Solvers. Some TRIIII Challenge Statements only request limited information from Solvers, but others contain detailed criteria for Accepted Solutions, such criteria located in password-protected areas of the Site (“Project Rooms”). By using this Site, you acknowledge that TRIIII does not control in any manner the nature, quality, legality or timing of TRIIII Challenges. You agree that TRIIII is a neutral forum for TRIIII Challenges and Solver Proposed Solutions.
            TRIIII desires to make your use of this Site enjoyable, and will endeavor to keep postings related to the results of Proposed Solutions and Awards paid as current as possible. However, we do not guarantee that the postings or content on this Site will be current at all times. Furthermore, you understand that you may create a Proposed Solution for an TRIIII Challenge that may have a recently Accepted Solution, and for which the Award has already been paid, and for which we have not yet updated the Site to reflect such payment.
        </p>
